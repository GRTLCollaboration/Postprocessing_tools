The bash script processing.sh takes a pout.0 from a run and parses it so that it is in a format that reads 'level, time, boxes on this proc, total boxes'. Run using './processing.sh' in the same directory as the pout.0 and it outputs pout.0_parsed

This pout.0_parsed can then be processed by running 'python extractboxes.py' to plot the total number of boxes per refinement level. Must manually set max refinement level to plot in L16. Outputs a graph for each level i which includes all levels < i, easily modifiable.
